Welcome to my website! I am currently a PhD student at [NYU Sociology](https://as.nyu.edu/sociology.html) and my research centers on inequality, cultural sociology, and computational methods. I am currently working on my dissertation and several other projects on how inequality affects political actions and discourse across time and space.

Welcome! I'm a Sociology Ph.D. candidate at [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/sociology.html) currently on the job market. My research has been published in *American Sociological Review*, *Sociological Science*, *Scientific Reports*, and other venues.  

My research focuses on the theorization and measurement of social class. For my dissertation, I develop a novel methodology that measures class based on the task content of detailed occupations. Leveraging AI language models, I measure class position based on occupation incumbents' decision-making power in the financial, production, and authority dimensions of work. By linking this class information to large-scale surveys, I study the evolution of the American class structure from the 1970s to the 2020s. This study lays the foundation for my future research agenda on the geography of class and class-based voting patterns. The paper based on parts of my dissertation is the winner of the [2025 Erik Olin Wright Prize](https://havenswrightcenter.wisc.edu/2025/07/30/2025-recipient/) awarded by the [Havens Wright Center for Social Justice](https://havenswrightcenter.wisc.edu/eow-prize/).

In the meantime, I am interested in developing innovative computational methods to study other classical sociological processes. For my third-year paper, I developed a diachronic measure of novelty and examined various pathways to cultural power in Chinese netizens' political discussions of U.S. politics.

Welcome! I'm a Sociology Ph.D. candidate at [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/sociology.html). My research focuses on using innovative computational methods to study the pattern of inequality and the evolution of ideas. My dissertation research explores the relationship between social class and occupational structure in the U.S. using supervised machine learning and statistical modeling. I'm also involved in projects that examine how discourse and opinions change over time using computational text analysis.

Hi there, welcome to my website! I am a PhD student at [NYU Sociology](https://as.nyu.edu/sociology.html).  

My research centers on inequality, cultural sociology, and computational methods. I am working on my dissertation and several other projects on how inequality affects political actions and discourse across time and space.

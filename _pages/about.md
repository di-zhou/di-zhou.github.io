Welcome to my website! I'm a Sociology Ph.D. candidate at [NYU](https://as.nyu.edu/sociology.html). My research focuses on using innovative computational methods to understand key sociological concepts. My dissertation research explores the relationship between social class and occupational structure in the U.S. I'm also involved in projects that examine how discourse and opinions change over time using computational text analysis.

Hi there, welcome to my website! I am a PhD student at [NYU Sociology](https://as.nyu.edu/sociology.html).  

My research focuses on understanding core sociological concepts using innovative, computational methods. My dissertation focuses on the relationship bewteen social class and occupational structure in the U.S. At the same time, I work on several other projects that study how discourse and opinions change over time.

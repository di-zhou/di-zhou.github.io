My research revolves around two related interests. First, I am interested in how inequality and class structure affects political attitudes and political actions. Second, I am interested in using computational text analysis to study how discourse and opinions evolve over time.

  * **Inequality in American Suburbs** [Work in Progress]  
      * Dissertation project
          * Committee Chair: Vivek Chibber, NYU Sociology
      * In my dissertation research, I explore trends in inequality in American suburbs -an increasingly diverse yet unequal political battlefield in the American political geography. I use census and ACS data to describe the change in demographic composition and class structure in the past five decades.

  * **The Construction of Economic Subjects in Business-related Self-Help Books** [Work in Progress]  
      * Co-author with Carly Knight, NYU Sociology
      * Using a novel dataset of New York Times best seller lists since the 1970s, we analyze how the discourse on work, self, and employment change overtime in Business-related self-help books. Specifically, we analyze how economic subjects are constructed overtime in parallel with the rise of neoliberalism.

  * **Chinese Public Sentiments towards the U.S. and Democracy, 2011 to 2020** [Work in Progress] 
      * Co-author with Yinxian Zhang, Queens College Sociology, CUNY
      * This project describes the long-term change in public sentiments towards the U.S. among Chinese internet users using political discussion data collected from Zhihu, the most popular online question-and-answer community in China that resembles Quora. Tracking sentiment change among Chinese netizens from 2011 to 2020, this paper provides a long-term overview of Chinese online sentiments in a rapidly changing decade. In addition, by leveraging measurement of the popularity of posts, this study empirically tests whether there is a discrepancy between prevalent versus popular sentiments.

  * **The Elements of Cultural Power: Novelty, Emotion, Status, and Cultural Capital** [Forthcoming] 
      * Solo author. Forthcoming on *American Sociological Review*
      * Why do certain ideas catch on? What makes some ideas more powerful than others? In this article, I examines key predictors of cultural power—novelty, emotion, status, and linguistic features—using an innovative diachronic word-embedding method. The study finds a curvilinear relationship between novelty and resonance, as well as a positive relationship between status and cultural power. Contrary to theoretical expectations, moderate emotions, whether positive or negative, are found to be more effective in evoking resonance than more intense emotions, possibly due to the mediating effect of the forum’s “group style.” The study also finds significant effects of linguistic features, such as lexical diversity and the use of English in Chinese discussions. This suggests a Bourdieusian “cultural capital signaling and selection” path to cultural power, which has not been considered in most studies of resonance.

  * **[Child and Youth Well-being in China](https://www.routledge.com/Child-and-Youth-Well-being-in-China/Chen-Yang-Zhou-Ren/p/book/9780367670368)** [Published]   
      * Co-authored with Lijun Chen (Chapin Hill at the University of Chicago), Dali Yang (the University of Chicago), and Qiang Ren (Peking University)
      * Using data from the longitudinal Chinese Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey, this book analyzes the well-being of Chinese children and youth from multiple dimensions. We not only pay attention to the economic, physical, psychological, cognitive, and attitudinal development of children in China, but also analyze how social and institutional context (such as migration and parental absence) affects child development.
